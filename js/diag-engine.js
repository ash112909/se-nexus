    diagnosis:`The SJIII 3219 "no lift" condition is most commonly caused by one of four things, in order of likelihood:

**1. Solenoid valve failure** — The lift solenoid (connector C6 on the base manifold) should read 24V DC when the lift switch is active. Check coil resistance: spec is 18–22 Ω. An open circuit means a failed coil.

**2. Pump output loss** — Connect a pressure gauge to Port A on the pump. Normal output is 2,500–2,800 PSI at rated RPM. Below 2,000 PSI indicates pump wear or internal bypass.

**3. Relief valve stuck open** — If pressure at Port A is normal but no lift movement occurs, the relief valve may be bypassing before system pressure builds. Replace as an assembly (non-adjustable on SJIII 3219).

**4. Low or contaminated fluid** — Check fluid level at the reservoir sight glass. Minimum level: 3/4 full at rest. Fluid specification: ISO 46 AW hydraulic oil.`,
    steps:[
      'Check hydraulic fluid level at reservoir sight glass. Refill if below 3/4.',
      'Activate lift switch. Verify 24V DC signal at solenoid connector C6 using a multimeter.',
      'If signal present, check solenoid coil resistance: spec 18–22 Ω. Replace coil or valve if open/short.',
      'Connect pressure gauge to Port A on pump. Activate lift — record pressure. Normal: 2,500–2,800 PSI.',
      'If pressure <2,000 PSI with good fluid level, suspect pump wear — inspect pump seal kit first.',

    severity:'medium',
    diagnosis:`Slow lift on the SJIII 3219 usually means reduced pump volumetric efficiency or restriction in the hydraulic circuit.

**Most likely causes:**
- **Pump wear** — Gear pump efficiency degrades with hours. At >2,000 hrs, volumetric efficiency often drops below spec (1.2 GPM rated). Check: pressure at Port A should still be 2,500+ PSI but flow rate is reduced.
- **Wrong or degraded fluid** — ISO 68 fluid at cold temperatures becomes too viscous and slows flow. Check fluid type (spec: ISO 46 AW) and temperature.
- **Dirty hydraulic filter** — A partially bypassing filter causes flow restriction. Replace if bypass indicator has extended at any point.
- **Partial solenoid restriction** — Debris on the solenoid spool can cause partial restriction without fully blocking flow.`,
    steps:[
      'Check fluid type and condition — should be ISO 46 AW, clear/amber. Milky fluid = water contamination.',

    severity:'high',
    diagnosis:`Platform drift on the SJIII 3219 is a significant safety concern. Acceptable maximum drift is **2 inches per minute** at rated load (500 lb). Anything beyond that requires immediate investigation.

**Primary cause: Cylinder internal seal wear** — The lift cylinder rod seal and piston seal wear over time, allowing fluid to bypass back to reservoir under load. The cylinder seal replacement interval is **3,000 hours**. Refer to **Service Bulletin SB-2847** for the revised procedure that applies to serial SJ3219-00600 and later.

**Secondary cause: Control valve leak-by** — The solenoid spool may not be fully seating when de-energized, allowing slow fluid return. Test by isolating: close the manual shut-off valve between pump and cylinder (if fitted) and re-check drift rate. If drift stops, the leak is upstream of the cylinder.

**Check valve** — A failed check valve in the lift circuit allows reverse flow. Test with a pressure gauge held at the cylinder port with valve isolated.`,
    steps:[
      'Measure actual drift rate: raise to full height, place 500 lb on platform, measure drop over 1 minute.',
      'If >2 in/min, raise and block platform for safety before further inspection.',
      'Visually inspect cylinder rod for scoring, pitting, or seal extrusion around rod seal area.',
      'Check service hours — if >3,000 hr, seal replacement is overdue regardless of measured drift.',
      'Isolate the cylinder from the valve by closing the manual shut-off (if fitted) and re-measure drift.',
      'If drift stops when isolated: valve leak-by. Replace or clean solenoid spool.',
      'If drift continues when isolated: cylinder seals failed. Order seal kit SKJ-103100. Follow SB-2847.',

    diagnosis:`External hydraulic leaks on the SJIII 3219 require immediate attention — fluid on the ground is both an environmental and slip hazard, and loss of fluid will cause HYD-01 (low pressure) if uncorrected.

**Locate the source first:**
- **Cylinder rod seal:** Most common leak point. Look for oil tracking down the cylinder rod. Replace rod wiper seal (SKJ-103445) as a minimum; full seal kit (SKJ-103100) preferred.
- **Hydraulic filter housing:** Check the filter housing O-ring and drain plug. A weeping filter base often looks like a pump or line leak.
- **Hose connections and fittings:** Inspect all JIC and NPT connections in the lift circuit. Wrench-tighten any weepers — do not over-torque.
- **Pump seal:** Oil around the pump drive shaft indicates pump shaft seal failure. Replace pump seal kit (SKJ-HYD-201).`,

**Key distinction:** Is the machine trying to drive (motor energized but wheels don't turn) or completely unresponsive?

- **Unresponsive:** Check emergency stop status. Both base and platform E-stops must be reset. Check battery voltage under load (>22V required).
- **Motor energized but no movement:** Suspect brake not releasing (DRV-02). The electromagnetic brake requires >18V to release. Check brake solenoid voltage at connector B3.
- **Drive disabled at height:** Normal operation — drive speed is restricted when platform is elevated and disabled above approximately 6 ft (DRV-03). Lower the platform fully.

**Main Controller (ELC-02):**
The base controller logs fault codes via LED blink patterns. Inspect connectors J1–J4 for corrosion before replacing. This is the most expensive component on the machine — confirm all wiring is clean first.

    diagnosis:`Scissor arm wear pads and pins are the most commonly overlooked wear items on the SJIII 3219.

**Wear Pads (SKJ-PAD-601):**
UHMW polyethylene pads slide between scissor arm channels. Replace when remaining thickness is less than **1/4 inch** or when any lateral play becomes visible. A worn wear pad allows the scissor arm to contact the structural channel directly, causing scoring and accelerated structural wear. Replace pads in sets — all upper or all lower at once.

**Scissor Arm Pins (SKJ-PIN-600):**
Inspect pins for scoring, grooving, and elongated pin holes. Spec: 25mm diameter. Replace if worn below 24.5mm. Lubricate all pins every 250 hr with multi-purpose grease (not white lithium). A dry pin will cause binding on elevation and often sounds like a structural creak.

**Noise diagnosis:**
- Creak/groan on elevation: dry pins — lubricate first before replacing
- Grinding: worn pad allowing metal-to-metal contact
- Clunk: loose or worn pin — inspect and replace`,
    steps:[
      'Lower platform fully. Inspect all wear pads — check thickness at thinnest visible point.',
      'Replace all pads on one horizontal channel as a set if any pad is <1/4" thick.',
      'Inspect all scissor arm pins. Measure diameter with calipers — replace if <24.5mm.',
      'Check pin holes for elongation by attempting lateral movement at each joint.',
      'Lubricate all pins with multi-purpose grease before raising the platform.',
      'Raise and lower the platform 3× to distribute grease and re-check for noise.',
